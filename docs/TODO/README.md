## Refs

- Test: `node tests/run.mjs` — boots its own vite on :5199, drives local Chrome;
  one `tests/<slug>.test.mjs` per interactive component. (Dev server on :5173
  only needed for manual/screenshot QA.)
- Build: `npm run build`. No lint configured.
- Conventions + gotchas: `docs/HANDOFF.md` (block classes, tokens-only CSS, `cn()`,
  `as` prop, `useControllableState` + `data-state`, `usePresence`, demo page +
  `playground/registry.js` entry per component).
- Load-bearing files: `styles/globals.css` (tokens), `lib/` primitives,
  `ui/toggle/` (stateful pattern), `ui/tabs/` (roving tabindex), `ui/accordion/`
  (disclosure/presence), `playground/registry.js`.
- Git gates (hooks): no commits on main — `<type>/<kebab>` branch first; PR cap
  500 net lines vs main.

## Adjustments log

- 2026-07-22 — seeded from plan file + HANDOFF.md inventory (31/64 done).
- 2026-07-22 — added 28 docs-shell + 29 docs-content: evolve playground into a
  docs app (install/usage/config incl. motion knobs) after the component cycle.
- 2026-07-22 — split task 01 (pagination-toggle-group) into 01 toggle-group + 02
  pagination; TODO seed + toggle-group hit ~350 net lines on one branch (cap
  500). Renumbered 02→03 … 26→27. Runner note: tests self-host on :5199, no dev
  server needed.
- 2026-07-22 — task 03 done on `feat/field-direction` (~476 net lines): Field is
  CSS-only (no test, like item); direction lib pre-existed — task became demo
  page + RTL test + physical→logical CSS sweep (button-group, typography).
  Slider already handled RTL fully. New components: use logical properties
  (`inline-start`/`margin-inline`/`text-align: start`) from the start.
- 2026-07-22 — task 04 done on `feat/chat-message-bubble` (~490 net lines):
  shadcn anatomy verified against live docs — Bubble/BubbleContent/
  BubbleReactions/BubbleGroup, Message/MessageGroup/MessageAvatar/MessageContent/
  MessageHeader/MessageFooter. Both CSS-only, no tests. shadcn's `render` prop →
  our `as`. Task 05 (attachment + message-scroller) will need scroll/state logic
  — verify its live anatomy the same way.
- 2026-07-22 — split task 05 into 05 attachment (CSS-only) + 06 message-scroller
  (stateful: Provider/Viewport/Content/Item/Button, stick-to-bottom autoscroll
  released on user scroll, 3 hooks — verified against live shadcn docs); both in
  one PR would blow the 500-line cap given task 04 landed ~490 for two CSS-only
  components. Renumbered 06→29 to 07→30, dep refs shifted.
- 2026-07-22 — task 05 done on `feat/attachment` (~446 net lines). Gotcha:
  `mask-image` directly on a scrolling element makes Chrome paint the whole
  pane white in dark mode (invisible in light!) — mask a static wrapper,
  scroll an inner viewport. Applies to any future edge-fade scroller
  (scroll-area 20, carousel 24, sidebar 27). QA dark mode via clip screenshots
  or after the fix, not just light.
